# Download Processor Host

Host app for the Download Processor extensions (Firefox and Chrome) for OSX/MacOS.

You can find the install scipts and executable for your browser in the sub folders. The executable for both browsers is the same, only the host json files and install scripts differ.

Please do not move the host json and executable after running the install scripts, else the path where your browser looks for the executable is wrong. To move the executable run the uninstall script first and the install script again after moving.
